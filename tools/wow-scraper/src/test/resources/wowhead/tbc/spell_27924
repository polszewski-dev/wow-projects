THAT is not that small.[\/i]\n\nThis is not how + spell damage works. You clearly took 24\/1.5 (casting delay of an instant spell) = 16. Sadly, though, instant spells only get 21.4% of the damage bonus (disregarding talents, etc). This means that you are only getting 24 * .214 \/1.5 = 3.424 DPS. Same scenario: 3.424*10 = 34.24 DPS. 34.24 * 60 * 5 = 10272 damage. This IS nothing. Really. When you are doing ~2000 damage per shot, and this is a FIVE MINUTE fight, who cares about the extra .75 seconds for these 10 casters to get in five extra shots. Also consider just how many HP this boss must have, and again 10272 damage is insignificant.\n\n[i]24 spell damage is a lot. +8 Stats is a lot.\nHunter: 80 health, 16 Armor, 8 AP, .2% Crit, 120 Mana.\nRogue: 80 health, 16 Armor, .4% Dodge, 8 AP, .2% Crit.\n\nI don't know about you but, that is a big difference.

I'm sure if a player has an enchanter they make good use of them 99.9% of the time (The other .1% had a heart attack finishing the enchantment marathon to upper 300s when the realized what the spent in time and gold).\n\nThe point is that for 200g you can get a better bonus from a meta gem, or from (gasp) a few enchants here or there. You don't need enchanting for this.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>It's totally fair when an enchanter gets an edge in the game.&nbsp; Especially when people don't tip or want an enchant below the mats cost.&nbsp; I just don't think people realize the grinding time and leveling cost of enchanting.&nbsp; I'm glad we get an edge.&nbsp; Engineers get soulbound items for their personal use that others don't get.&nbsp; Just one of the perks of the profession. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>its not just the added 24. its all the added power in general. i dont wanna cry about it either, so i simply rerolled enchanting. <br /><br />^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Engineers have goggles.&nbsp; Leatherworkers (and blacksmiths and tailors) have bind-on-pickup armor.&nbsp; The ring enchants are there to give an incentive to be an enchanter yourself, rather than the rich guildmate of an enchanter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>im confused as how to anyone in this thread can be complaining about enchanters getting a bit more spellpower,&nbsp; Theres blacksmiths out there with exclusive rights to awesome epic weapons, going from a blue to a sweet epic is far more of a power up than any enchant can match, and yet here we are complaining that enchants arent fair in arena?&nbsp; every profession gets perks.&nbsp; Id rather have a choice of what advantage i get rather than have no perks and hope i need to make alot of use of my profession.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>leveling enchanting is easy that dude did take it too seriously (Reachfell187). I leveld to 310 in 3 days.1st leveled to 1-150 cheap cause the mats are CHEAP,2nd i de usless greens from the guild bank(we have ALOT) to level 150-250.Last since im a level 70 rogue i went through level 50 instances to stealth to bosses for shards(in 1 hour I get like 70 shards in the 5 boss instance rdf)...finally the creme de la creme(or however its spelled) I sold fiery enchants for only 20g(in my server usually 26-30g),you can only imagine the number of whispers i gotten,made easily 250g in a few hours. So that Reachfella needs to stfu because leveling from 310-375 only took me about a week in total.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a thought! We should reeeaaalllyy analize this more 'cause if it really stays active once you've done it even when/if you drop enchanting then it's a lil' unbalanced imo. Is there any other prof that has this? I mean special things that only those in that specific profession can make for themselves and only they can use them. i.e. &quot;alchem. stone&quot; it req alch. .. if you make it and after that you drop alch it's useless. what you say guys? I'm not the &quot;nerf that&quot; adept here for I'm also an enchanter and I've droped alch where I was aiming for that &quot;sorcerers alch stone&quot; but I got tired! now IF those would remain active even after I'd drop ench I'd go till I get them then drop and take back alch or something else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>24 spell damage is a lot. +8 Stats is a lot. <br />Hunter: 80 health, 16 Armor, 8 AP, .2% Crit, 120 Mana.<br />Rogue: 80 health, 16 Armor, .4% Dodge, 8 AP, .2% Crit. <br /><br />I don't know about you but, that is a big difference. I guess not so much if you don't do anything where &quot;every little&quot; helps. Not to be a %^&amp;* to the above poster but...8 stats is a lot for a Hunter, Rogue, Tank, or uh...lots of classes. And the attitude that 24 spell damage isn't much, well you people prolly don't even think about end game content. Not that I'm an expert or anything, I just began SSC/Hyjal, but, c'mon, if 24 spell damage is nothing, then you might as well not bother filling your sockets, because it'll only nominally increase your dps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Also, for me 24 spell damage is about 16 DpS. If 10 DpS guys in a raid think that 16 DpS isn't anything, then the raid loses 160 DpS. I know, that seems like nothing. BUT, that's 48,000 Damage over a 5 minute fight. THAT is not that small.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>what rod does this require?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3><i>Also, for me 24 spell damage is about 16 DpS.

THAT is not that small.</i><br /><br />This is not how + spell damage works. You clearly took 24/1.5 (casting delay of an instant spell) = 16. Sadly, though, instant spells only get 21.4% of the damage bonus (disregarding talents, etc). This means that you are only getting 24 * .214 /1.5 = 3.424 DPS. Same scenario: 3.424*10 = 34.24 DPS. 34.24 * 60 * 5 = 10272 damage. This IS nothing. Really. When you are doing ~2000 damage per shot, and this is a FIVE MINUTE fight, who cares about the extra .75 seconds for these 10 casters to get in five extra shots. Also consider just how many HP this boss must have, and again 10272 damage is insignificant.<br /><br /><i>24 spell damage is a lot. +8 Stats is a lot.<br />Hunter: 80 health, 16 Armor, 8 AP, .2% Crit, 120 Mana.<br />Rogue: 80 health, 16 Armor, .4% Dodge, 8 AP, .2% Crit.<br /><br />I don't know about you but, that is a big difference.

I'm sure if a player has an enchanter they make good use of them 99.9% of the time (The other .1% had a heart attack finishing the enchantment marathon to upper 300s when the realized what the spent in time and gold).<br /><br />The point is that for 200g you can get a better bonus from a meta gem, or from (gasp) a few enchants here or there. You don't need enchanting for this. Everyone is pointing out that this is not overpowered, and even be buffed because it is a 2000g enchant PLUS what you are losing not taking BS/ENGI/LW/etc. Those have better &quot;bits&quot; for your &quot;every little&quot; standpoint. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Henderman</b></h3>While the item text says &quot;+12 Spell Damage&quot;, this enchant <u>does</u> increase healing. Look at your Bonus Healing on your character sheet before and after enchanting and you will see the increase in healing.</div>
